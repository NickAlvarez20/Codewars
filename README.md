## Project Name
Codewars Solutions
## About
This repository contains my personal solutions to various coding challenges (katas) from Codewars, organized by programming language. Solutions in C++, Go, and SQL are in the main branch, with additional TypeScript solutions in the typeScriptChallenges branch.
## Prerequisites
To run this project you need C++, Go, SQL, or TypeScript (Node.js) installed on your system, depending on the solutions you want to explore.
No additional libraries are required.
## Features
This Codewars Solutions includes these features:
* Solutions implemented in multiple languages (C++, Go, SQL on main; TypeScript on typeScriptChallenges branch)
* Organized folder structure by programming language
* Variety of kata solutions for practice and reference
## Getting Started & Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/NickAlvarez20/Codewars.git`
## Usage
Run the C++, Go, SQL, or TypeScript script from the command line (depending on the file extension and branch):
`go run sum_mixed_array.go`
## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me:
* Improve problem-solving skills through diverse coding challenges
* Practice and gain proficiency in C++, Go, SQL, and TypeScript
* Explore different approaches to algorithmic problems
## Contributing
This is primarily a personal learning / portfolio repository, so formal contributions aren’t required. However, if you spot bugs, have project ideas, or want to add improvements, feel free to:
1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch
3. Submit a pull request Please include clear explanations of your changes and test any new code.
